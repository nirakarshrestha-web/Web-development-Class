         <h2> WHO Bata usa out</h2>
         <p> The US has officially withdrawn from the World Health Organization (WHO), leaving the UN agency without one of its biggest donors.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order signalling the withdrawal a year ago, having criticised the organisation for being too "China-centric" during the Covid pandemic.

The US Department of Health and Human Services said it took the decision due to the WHO's alleged "mishandling" of the pandemic, an inability to reform and political influence from member states.</p>

            <h2> USA and WHO to be unsafe </h2>
            <p> WHO regrets the United States' notification of withdrawal from WHO – a decision that makes both the United States and the world less safe.</p>
